# Canadian Chinchilla Rescue

> **Every chinchilla deserves a loving home**

We rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome chinchillas across Ontario. Our mission is to provide these gentle creatures with the care they deserve and find them forever families.

## üê≠ About the Rescue

Canadian Chinchilla Rescue is dedicated to:

- **Rescuing** chinchillas from abandonment, surrender, and neglect
- **Rehabilitating** chinchillas with proper veterinary care and socialization
- **Rehoming** chinchillas to carefully screened, loving families
- **Educating** the public about proper chinchilla care and welfare

### Our Impact

We work with foster families across the Greater Toronto Area to provide temporary homes for chinchillas in need. Every chinchilla receives:

- Veterinary examination and care
- Proper nutrition and housing
- Socialization and enrichment
- A thorough adoption screening process
